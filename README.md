### Objective

Space Invaders in GreenGame retains the classic objective of defending the Earth from invading alien spaceships. However, the game incorporates themes of environmental sustainability by visualizing the alien ships as symbols of pollution or climate change, aligning with the project's educational goals.

### Gameplay

Players control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, moving horizontally to shoot projectiles at descending alien ships. The objective is to eliminate all alien ships before they reach the bottom of the screen or shoot down the player's spaceship.

### Key Features

- **Environmental Themes**: Alien ships represent environmental threats, reinforcing the project's sustainability message.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks player scores and records high scores for competitive play.
- **Level Progression**: Increasing difficulty levels as players advance through the game.
- **Integration with Login System**: User scores and progress are tied to their accounts, allowing for persistent gameplay across sessions.

### Other Games

The GreenGame project includes six other games, each designed to engage users with different aspects of environmental sustainability through interactive gameplay.
